# Operators

Solidity supports the following types of operators.

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical (or Relational) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Conditional (or ternary) Operators

---

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator            | Description                                  | Example              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| + (Addition)        | Adds two operands                            | A + B will give 30   |
| - (Subtraction)     | Subtracts the second operand from the first  | A - B will give -10  |
| \* (Multiplication) | Multiply both operands                       | A \* B will give 200 |
| / (Division)        | Divide the numerator by the denominator      | B / A will give 2    |
| % (Modulus)         | Outputs the remainder of an integer division | B % A will give 0    |
| ++ (Increment)      | Increases an integer value by one            | A++ will give 11     |
| -- (Decrement)      | Decreases an integer value by one            | A-- will give 9      |

## Comparison Operators

| Operator                      | Description                                                                                                                                  | Example               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| = = (Equal)                   | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.                                               | (A == B) is not true. |
| != (Not Equal)                | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.                          | (A != B) is true.     |
| > (Greater than)              | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.             | (A > B) is not true.  |
| < (Less than)                 | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.                | (A < B) is true.      |
| >= (Greater than or Equal to) | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true. |
| <= (Less than or Equal to)    | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.    | (A <= B) is true.     |

## Logical (or Relational) Operators

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then âˆ’

| Operator          | Description                                                                                                          | Example              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --- | ----------- |
| && (Logical AND)  | If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.                                                  | (A && B) is true.    |
| \|\| (Logical OR) | If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.                                            | (A                   |     | B) is true. |
| ! (Logical NOT)   | Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the Logical NOT operator will make it false. | ! (A && B) is false. |

## Bitwise Operators

Assume variable A holds 2 and variable B holds 3, then âˆ’

| Operator                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| & (Bitwise AND)             | It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments. |
| \| (BitWise OR)             | It performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | (A \| B) is 3.                                                            |
| ^ (Bitwise XOR)             | It performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both.                                                                                                                      | (A ^ B) is 1.                                                             |
| ~ (Bitwise Not)             | It is a unary operator and operates by reversing all the bits in the operand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | (~B) is -4.                                                               |
| << (Left Shift)             | It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the number of places specified in the second operand. New bits are filled with zeros. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2, shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on. | (A << 1) is 4.                                                            |
| >> (Right Shift)            | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operand's value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.                                                                                                                                                                       | (A >> 1) is 1.                                                            |
| >>> (Right shift with Zero) | This operator is just like the >> operator, except that the bits shifted in on the left are always zero.                                                                                                                                                                                         | (A >>> 1) is 1.                                                           |

## Assignment Operators

| Operator                      | Description                                                                                       | Example                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| = (Simple Assignment )        | Assigns values from the right side operand to the left side operand                               | C = A + B will assign the value of A + B into C |
| += (Add and Assignment)       | It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.         | C += A is equivalent to C = C + A               |
| âˆ’= (Subtract and Assignment)  | It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  | C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A               |
| \*= (Multiply and Assignment) | It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. | C _= A is equivalent to C = C _ A               |
| /= (Divide and Assignment)    | It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.    | C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A               |
| %= (Modules and Assignment)   | It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.                   | C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A               |

**Note** âˆ’ Same logic applies to Bitwise operators so they will become like <<=, >>=, >>=, &=, |= and ^=

---

## Conditional Operator (? :)

The conditional operator first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then executes one of the two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation.

| Operator           | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ? : (Conditional ) | If Condition is true? Then value X : Otherwise value Y |
